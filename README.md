# Datanic
## Introduction
Datanic is a data science project to share my Pandas and Matplotlib skills.
I'm a huge fan of the Titanic (Olympic) Story. So I wanted to use a Titanic dataset to see which passengers were the most likely to get rescued.

## Steps
  * Firstly I needed to clean the Data. For that, I dropped all the data that didn't have any impact on the outcome.
  * Then I removed all the passengers with unknown ages and passengers that didn't embark
  * Lastly I printed the outcome by grouping people by sex and passenger class.
